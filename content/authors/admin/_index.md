#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Aloha! I preferred to be called as 'An', like 'An' in 'Android' (British pronunciation). I am a Computer Science student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal AI, Human-AI Interaction, AI for Science & Health, and anything about AI and Tech!

üî• I am currently on my path of research adventure, fueled by an unstoppable curiosity to explore the boundaries of AI and uncover new possibilities! To me, research is more than just finding answers‚Äîit's about creating, building, and pioneering breakthroughs that drive real-world impact. It‚Äôs a powerful tool to transform ideas into reality, develop AI that serves communities, and shape a future where technology makes a tangible difference. Every challenge is an opportunity to innovate, experiment, and redefine what AI can achieve, and I am ready to dive in, push forward, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of AI! üöÄ‚ú®
