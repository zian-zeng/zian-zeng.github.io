The Study Partner application was designed to help University of Hawaii ICS students form study groups based on shared courses and topics, using a profile-based system where students could act as mentors (senseis) or learners (grasshoppers). It featured a scheduling system for study sessions, a leaderboard for engagement, and an admin-monitored environment to ensure appropriate use, with the project leveraging Meteor, GitHub Actions, and TestCafe for development and deployment.
