publication: "The American Sign Language Knowledge Graph: Infusing ASL Models with Linguistic Knowledge"
publication_short: "ASLGK"

abstract: Language models for American Sign Language (ASL) could make language technologies substantially more accessible to those who sign. To train these models on tasks such as isolated sign recognition (ISR) and ASL-to-English translation, datasets provide video examples of ASL signs, facilitating deep learning methods. In order to improve the generalizability and explainability of these models, we introduce the American Sign Language Knowledge Graph (ASLKG), compiled from twelve sources of expert linguistic knowledge. We use the ASLKG to train neuro-symbolic models for 3 ASL understanding tasks, achieving 91% accuracy on ISR, 14% accuracy at predicting the semantic features of unseen signs, and 36% accuracy at classifying the topic of Youtube-ASL videos.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The **American Sign Language Knowledge Graph (ASLKG)** enhances the generalizability and explainability of ASL models by incorporating expert linguistic knowledge. Using ASLKG, we achieve **91% accuracy in isolated sign recognition (ISR)**, **14% accuracy in predicting semantic features of unseen signs**, and **36% accuracy in classifying Youtube-ASL video topics**.
