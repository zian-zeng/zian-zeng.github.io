      #   ## About Me

      #   Aloha! I preferred to be called as 'An', like 'An' in 'Android' (British pronunciation). I am a Computer Science student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal AI, Human-AI Interaction, AI for Science & Health, and anything about AI and Tech!

      #   ðŸ”¥ I am currently on my path of research adventure, fueled by an unstoppable curiosity to explore the boundaries of AI and uncover new possibilities! To me, research is more than just finding answersâ€”it's about creating, building, and pioneering breakthroughs that drive real-world impact. Itâ€™s a powerful tool to transform ideas into reality, develop AI that serves communities, and shape a future where technology makes a tangible difference. Every challenge is an opportunity to innovate, experiment, and redefine what AI can achieve, and I am ready to dive in, push forward, and contribute to the ever-evolving world of AI! ðŸš€âœ¨

        My recent research focuses on advancing **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal AI, and Human-AI Interaction** to tackle impactful challenges in science, health, and accessibility.

        I have worked on:
        - **Neuro-symbolic models** for American Sign Language (ASL) understanding, achieving high performance in isolated sign recognition and laying the groundwork for phoneme-to-sign pipelines.
        - Developing **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems and Chain-of-Query prompting techniques to enhance reasoning in LLMs.
        - **Chatbot dialog design for improved human performance in domain knowledge discovery**, optimizing conversational AI to facilitate efficient knowledge retrieval, enhance user engagement, and support domain-specific learning.
        - Applying **explainable AI (XAI)** in healthcare, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) eye-tracking classification using cutting-edge models like Vision Transformers.

        Through my research, I strive to bridge the gap between humans and AI by creating solutions that are inclusive, transparent, and impactful. Collaboration fuels progress, so letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€ðŸ˜ƒ
